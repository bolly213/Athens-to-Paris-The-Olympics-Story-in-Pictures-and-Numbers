### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

  1. Data Loading and inspection.

### Explorative Data Analysis

This involved answering questions that includes:

- Number of participants in both summer and winter olympics over the years
- Ratio of gender participations
- Revenue generated from broadcast
- Budget allocations
- Participation by different LOCs
- Medals won by athletes and countries over the years.
  
### Data Analysis

### Results And Findings

- A progressive increase and popularity in the acceptance and numbers of the less popular winter games. 
- A journey of 241 at inception, moved to 5,300 athletes in 1960, and now few numbers shy away from 11,000 
- Paris 2024 marks a milestone as a parity of 50% was shared between the male and their female counterpart for the first in a journey that started with 100%(241) male at the first edition in Athens about 128 years ago.
- The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia hold the record for the highest total cost, with an estimated huge amount spent on infrastructure, venues, and operational costs. This staggering amount was largely due to the construction of new venues, transportation systems, and infrastructure from scratch.
- Just like 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, Rio 2016 hold the record for the highest total cost in Summer Olympics, with an estimated huge amount also spent on infrastructure, venues, and operational costs. This staggering amount was largely due to the construction of new venues, transportation systems, and infrastructure from scratch.
- The TV broadcast revenue from the Olympic Games has experienced a significant increase over the years, driven by growing global interest, improved broadcasting technology, and the rise of digital platforms. 
- The United States stands out as the most successful Summer Olympic nation, with an impressive total of 2755 medals. Russia (1624 medals) and Germany (1410 medals) follows the queue, while China and Great Britain concludes the Top 5
- Germany, Norway and Russia have consistently performed well across various Winter Olympic sports, including alpine skiing, figure skating, speed skating, and cross-country skiing. Germany stands out as the most successful Winter Olympic nation, with an impressive total of 435 medals.



### Recommendations And Conclusion

In conclusion, the journey through the numbers from Athens to Paris has revealed the incredible growth and evolution of the Olympic Games. From humble beginnings with just 241 athletes in 1896 to the global spectacle of over 11,000 athletes expected in Paris 2024, the Olympics have become a beacon of international unity and athletic excellence.
We've seen the steady rise of women's participation, the expansion of events and sports, and the increasing global reach of the Games. These numbers tell a story of progress, perseverance, and the unwavering commitment to the Olympic ideals.
As we look beyond Paris 2024, we're reminded that the Olympics are more than just a sporting event â€“ they're a celebration of human achievement, a symbol of hope and unity, and a testament to the power of numbers to tell a story that inspires us all. It is therefore important that we continue to see the games as a means of sociocultural integration and a good avenue to develop our cities and her amenities
